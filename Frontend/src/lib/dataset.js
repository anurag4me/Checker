      question: "Explain the concept of photosynthesis and its importance in ecosystems.",
      userAnswer:
        "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. Plants use carbon dioxide and water to create glucose and oxygen.",
      correctAnswer:
        "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. Using chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide, they produce glucose and release oxygen as a byproduct. This process is crucial for ecosystems as it forms the base of most food chains and helps maintain atmospheric oxygen levels.",

      question: "Describe Newton's three laws of motion.",
      userAnswer:
        "First law: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Second law: Force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma). Third law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
      correctAnswer:
        "First law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an external force. Second law: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F=ma). Third law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",

      userAnswer:
        "Cellular respiration is how cells break down glucose to produce energy in the form of ATP. It involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.",
      correctAnswer:
        "Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose into ATP (energy). It occurs in three main stages: 1) Glycolysis (in cytoplasm): Glucose is broken down into pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH. 2) Krebs Cycle (in mitochondria): Pyruvate is further broken down, producing CO2, NADH, FADH2, and a small amount of ATP. 3) Electron Transport Chain (in mitochondrial membrane): NADH and FADH2 donate electrons that flow through a series of proteins, creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. The process requires oxygen as the final electron acceptor and produces water as a byproduct.",

      question: "Discuss the theme of identity in 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.",
      userAnswer:
        "In 'To Kill a Mockingbird', identity is explored through Scout's coming of age and learning about social classes in Maycomb. The novel shows how people are judged based on their race and social standing rather than their true character.",
      correctAnswer:
        "In 'To Kill a Mockingbird', Harper Lee explores identity through multiple dimensions: racial identity (Tom Robinson's case highlights racial prejudice), social identity (the rigid class structure of Maycomb), moral identity (Atticus's unwavering principles versus the town's hypocrisy), and personal identity (Scout's coming-of-age journey). The novel demonstrates how societal expectations often conflict with one's true self, as seen in characters like Boo Radley, who is misjudged based on rumors. Through Scout's perspective, Lee shows how identity is both shaped by and can transcend social constructs, ultimately arguing that one's moral character should define their identity rather than external factors like race or class.",

      question: "Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.",
      userAnswer:
        "Supply and demand is an economic model that explains how prices are determined in a market. When demand increases, prices rise. When supply increases, prices fall.",
      correctAnswer:
        "Supply and demand is a fundamental economic model that explains how prices are determined in a competitive market. The law of demand states that, all else equal, as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases (and vice versa), creating a downward-sloping demand curve. The law of supply states that as the price increases, the quantity supplied increases (and vice versa), creating an upward-sloping supply curve. The intersection of these curves determines the market equilibrium price and quantity. Changes in factors other than price (like income, preferences, production costs) cause shifts in the entire curves rather than movements along them, leading to new equilibrium points.",

      question: "Describe the water cycle and its importance.",
      userAnswer:
        "The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. Water evaporates from bodies of water, forms clouds, falls as rain, and collects in oceans, lakes, and groundwater. It's important because it provides fresh water for all living things.",
      correctAnswer:
        "The water cycle (hydrologic cycle) is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface. It involves several processes: evaporation (water changing from liquid to gas), transpiration (water vapor released from plants), condensation (water vapor forming clouds), precipitation (rain, snow, etc. falling to Earth), infiltration (water soaking into soil), runoff (water flowing over land), and collection in bodies of water. The cycle is crucial for: maintaining Earth's temperature, providing fresh water for ecosystems and human use, supporting all life forms, weathering rocks and forming soil, and transporting minerals across the planet. Climate change is affecting the water cycle by altering precipitation patterns and increasing evaporation rates.",

      question: "Explain the concept of democracy and compare direct and representative democracy.",
      userAnswer:
        "Democracy is government by the people. In direct democracy, citizens vote directly on laws, while in representative democracy, they elect representatives to make laws for them.",
      correctAnswer:
        "Democracy is a system of government where power ultimately resides with citizens, either directly or through elected representatives. In direct democracy, citizens participate personally in deliberations and voting on legislation and policy (as in ancient Athens or modern Swiss cantons). This allows for maximum citizen participation but can be unwieldy in large populations and complex societies. In representative democracy, citizens elect officials to represent their interests and make decisions on their behalf (as in most modern democracies). This is more practical for large nations but can create distance between citizens and decision-making. The two forms differ in terms of citizen participation, efficiency, accountability, and suitability for different population sizes and complexity of issues.",

        "DNA is made of nucleotides arranged in a double helix. It contains genetic information that determines traits.",
      correctAnswer:
        "DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double-stranded molecule structured as a double helix. Each strand consists of nucleotides containing a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine). The strands are connected by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs (A-T and G-C) and run antiparallel to each other. DNA's primary function is to store and transmit genetic information that guides protein synthesis through the processes of transcription and translation. It also replicates itself during cell division to pass genetic information to daughter cells. DNA determines inherited traits, controls cellular activities, and enables evolution through mutations and genetic recombination.",
